<center><h1 style="color: white; background-color: Red;"> Alfa Romeo Guilia </h1></center>
<p style="color: green;"> PERFORMANCE:
All-Aluminum 2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder Engine
From the low, idling growl to its full-throated roar, the all-aluminum 2.0L turbocharged engine makes the Giulia a ferocious contender. It produces Best-in-Class standard 280 horsepower
( Disclosure5)
 and Best-in-Class standard 306 pound-feet of torque
( Disclosure5)
 for a heart-racing Best-in-Class 0-60 time of 5.1 seconds with all-wheel-drive models
( Disclosure5)
</p>
<p style="color: blue;">BALANCING ACT: Alfa Romeo vehicles are engineered from the top down in order to achieve near-perfect 50/50 weight distribution. Doing so helps give the Giulia superb handling and steering across a variety of conditions, helping create a smooth drive with impressive grip, traction and control.</p>
